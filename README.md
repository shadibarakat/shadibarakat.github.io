#####PROJECTS
Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Developed a command-line based Tic Tac Toe game in Python that supports two-player gameplay and includes a simple AI opponent for single-player mode. The project involved implementing game logic to handle win conditions, draw scenarios, and input validation, ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience. I applied modular design principles by organizing the code into functions for game initialization, player input, board display, and status checks. The game provides clear instructions and a visually distinct game board in the terminal, enhancing the overall user experience. Additionally, I used Git for version control to manage and track code changes efficiently.
