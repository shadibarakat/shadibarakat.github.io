##Projects
###Tic-Tac-Toe Game
I have developed a command-line-based Tic Tac Toe game in Python that supports two-player gameplay and includes a simple AI opponent for single-player mode. The project involved implementing game logic to handle win conditions, draw scenarios, and input validation, ensuring a smooth and error-free user experience. I applied modular design principles by organizing the code into functions for game initialization, player input, board display, and status checks. The game provides clear instructions and a visually distinct game board in the terminal, enhancing the overall user experience. Additionally, I used Git for version control to manage and track code changes efficiently. [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/shadibarakat/Tic-Tac-Toe)

###Weather App
Developed a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that provides real-time weather information for any location. The app features a clean and intuitive user interface, allowing users to search for weather conditions by city name. I integrated a third-party weather API to fetch current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptions, which are dynamically displayed on the page. The design was crafted using responsive CSS to ensure the app looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. I also implemented error handling to provide user feedback for invalid inputs or network issues. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, API integration, and creating responsive, user-friendly web applications. [Weather App](https://github.com/shadibarakat/Weather-app)

###Calculator:
Built a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a clean and intuitive interface, with buttons for digits, operations, and clear functions. I used JavaScript to handle the logic for calculations, ensuring accurate results and handling edge cases like division by zero. The layout is styled with CSS, including a responsive design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from desktops to smartphones. This project highlights my proficiency in front-end development and my ability to create interactive, user-friendly web applications.[Calculator](https://github.com/shadibarakat/Calculator)


###Trivia
Developed a trivia app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that challenges users with a series of multiple-choice questions on various topics. The app features a dynamic and interactive interface where users can select answers and receive instant feedback on whether their choice was correct or incorrect. I implemented a scoring system that tracks the user's performance throughout the quiz. The questions and answers are managed through an array of objects, allowing for easy updates and expansions. The design is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices. Additionally, I added a timer feature to increase the challenge, encouraging users to think quickly. This project showcases my skills in front-end development, user interaction design, and JavaScript programming.
